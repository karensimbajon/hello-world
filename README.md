My first repository

Hello!
I'm Karen, an 18 year old IT student from University of Cebu. I love searching for the deeper part of anything, even analyzing the deeper meaning of the shallowest word. I'm also fond of asking the internet subjective questions or random questions like "what's the purpose of our earlobe?".
